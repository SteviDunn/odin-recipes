<h1>P is for Pesto</h1>
<h3>Question: Is pesto a sauce????</h3>
<h3>Answer: YES</h3>
<img src="../recipes/pesto.jpg">
<h4>This is Pesto. It tastes like garlic, nuts and basil (becauuse that's what it is).</h4>
<h4>Description:</h4>

    <p>Pesto was invented in Rome, Italy and originally used walnuts as the nut of choice. Today, I like to use roasted pine nuts in my recipe.<br> <br>Making pesto is an art. One 
        must find the best basil leaves from their local grocer. Make sure the leaves are not wilted! Basil is easy to grow at home too. <br><br> Pine nuts, on the other hand, are very difficult to 
        source yourself becasue it is hard to extract them from their cone. <em>Squirrels</em> can eat pine nuts easily by destroying the entire cone and leaving the droppings below on the 
        forest floor. <br> <br>Olive oil can be purchased at the store. I suggest using McEvoy Ranch olive oil grown and bottled in Napa, CA. Their olive oil is rich, pungent
        and tastes authentically Italian (I assume; I've never been to Italy...).
