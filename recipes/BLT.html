<h4>This is a BLT: bacon, lettuce and tomato. Order doesn't necessarily matter. It tastes like someone put childhood nostalgia between two slices of bread.</h4>
<h4>Description:</h4>

    <p>The BLT has European roots originating in 1920's Britain.<br> <br>The BLT was popularized in America during WW2 due to the ease with which women at home could
        buy, cook and assemble the ingredients.<br><br> The BLT holds a special place in my heart becaue I used to go to a local deli with my dad to buy BLT's with 
        freshly toasted bread and cooked bacon. We would also buy apply juice in a jar shaped like an apple and drink it with our sandwhiches in the car
        <br> <br>I reccommend this delightful dish to anyone seeking instant (or near instant) gratification and satisfaction.
